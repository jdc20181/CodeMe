**Coming Soon, Code in this folder is not ready**

*Info*

The code here isn't ready, but the purpose is to *not* check for new tags if there is no need. To do this, simply not having that function in the script 
will help. 

This of course will be at a AS IS - basis, thus, the code is iffy to work without the interval function. 

It will be some time before its ready. 


*Using on low quality or low resource servers*

Its uncertain if the code actually will abuse a server - as I haven't tested it, but if you have issues, create a issue I will be happy to help.
