#What you need
Call the CDN of Jquery `<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>` 
Call your CSS File 
Add the Jquery Code or use a Js file and call it. 


#Min CSS:

You can use the CSS without a Class by replacing the `.Code-Basic` with `code` and it will target the element `<code>` this is only good for those who wish to use the Simple Highlight - 
As more options flow through you may not wanna use that as you won't be able to change
the colors for the different languages. 


`.Code-Basic{
background-color:	#D3D3D3; /*Light Gray Defaults*/
color:black; /* Defaults*/
font-size:16px; /*Default Size*/
}`
