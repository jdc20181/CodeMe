# CodeMe
A Basic HTML Based -  Code highlighting Utility 


#Usage

To just highlight a line of code use this:

`<code class="Basic-Code">HTML</code>`


The Basic Highlighting of the intial start of this project is pretty basic. Right now there is only one class to be used. 

You can also not even use classes, but since this will support more than one language - there is a need for classes. 


#Highlighting Capabilities

This is a very basic highlight that is suppose to be light using Jquery/CSS/HTML5/ - Made for developers to integrate into online communities or even your website.

#Getting it ready

To get the latest release - as well as a installation guide visit the `lib` folder.  


#See it

<a href="https://jdc20181.github.io/CodeMe/"> Demo </a> is available. 

You can also use JS or Jquery or even php maybe to replace a shorter syntax 

with the `<code class="Code-Basic">Some</code>`

As of now I do not have anything built in.
