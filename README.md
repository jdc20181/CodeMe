# CodeMe
A Basic HTML Based -  Code highlighting Utility 


#Usage

To just highlight a line of code use this:

`<code class="Basic-Code">HTML</code>`


The Basic Highlighting of the intial start of this project is pretty basic. Right now there is only one class to be used. 

You can also not even use classes, but since this will support more than one language - there is a need for classes. 


#Highlighting Capabilities

This is a very basic highlight that is suppose to be light using Jquery/CSS/HTML5/ - Made for developers to integrate into online communities or even your website.

#Getting it ready

#See it

<a href="https://jdc20181.github.io/CodeMe/"> Demo </a> is available. 

You can also use JS or Jquery or even php maybe to replace a shorter syntax 

with the `<code class="Code-Basic">Some</code>`

As of now I do not have anything built in. 

#About

What happens with CodeMe is when you use the class - and with the Jquery/Js code, you can write code without it being executed. This helps prevent unformatted code, better presentations, etc. The possibilities are endless.

The `<code>` Tag has been around for a while, but  -  with any code put inside the tags are still executed. 

Thats why CodeMe as well as hundreds of projects like CodeMe exist. 

Using  The `<code` tags for easy use - and with jquery its easy to not execute it!
